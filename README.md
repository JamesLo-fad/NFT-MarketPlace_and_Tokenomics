# NFT-MarketPlace_and_Tokenomics

- Since the experimental cycle is available in dfx 0.9.3 version, please follow this version, instead of the newest version. 
- For more detailed explanation, please check the readme files embedded in the "opend" and "token-local" files respectively. The content of the "token-local" file is actually identical to the token project in my repositories, "Crypto-Token-DSpartan".
- The procedures for localhost: 
   1. dfx start / dfx start --clean
   2. npm install *(sudo rm -rf node_modules, if needed, under this circumstance: )
   3. dfx deploy
   4. npm start
- The token version with authentication, internet identity, is removed for simplicity, but still can refer to the token project in my repositories - "Crypto-Token-DSpartan".
